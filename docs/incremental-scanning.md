# Incremental Scanning

LucidShark supports two modes of incremental scanning:

1. **Default Mode (Uncommitted Changes)** - Scans only files with uncommitted changes (staged, unstaged, untracked). No extra flags needed.
2. **Branch Comparison Mode (`--base-branch`)** - Filters results to files changed since a branch. Useful for PR reviews and CI pipelines.

## Default Mode: Uncommitted Changes

**When developing locally, you don't need any special flags.** By default, LucidShark scans only uncommitted changes:

```bash
# Scans only uncommitted changes (default behavior)
./lucidshark scan --linting --type-checking

# Same via MCP
scan(domains=["linting", "type_checking"])
```

This mode:
- Detects staged files (`git add`)
- Detects unstaged modifications
- Detects untracked files
- Runs tools only on these files (where supported)

Use `--all-files` (CLI) or `all_files=true` (MCP) for a full project scan.

## Branch Comparison Mode: `--base-branch`

Use `--base-branch` when you want to filter results based on branch comparison. This is useful for:

- **Pull Request reviews**: Focus on the code being changed in the PR
- **CI pipelines**: Enforce standards on new/modified code only
- **Pre-merge checks**: Verify changes meet quality thresholds

### How It Works

1. **Full analysis runs** - All checks execute for accuracy (tests, linting, etc.)
2. **Results are filtered** - Only changed files are reported
3. **Threshold applies to filtered result** - Per-domain scope configuration

This approach ensures data is accurate (tests aren't skipped, cross-file issues are detected) while focusing your attention on the code you're changing.

## Quick Start

### Local Development (Default - Uncommitted Changes)

```bash
# Scan only uncommitted changes (default behavior)
./lucidshark scan --linting --type-checking

# Full project scan
./lucidshark scan --linting --type-checking --all-files
```

```bash
# Scan only uncommitted changes (default behavior)
./lucidshark scan --linting --type-checking

# Full project scan
./lucidshark scan --linting --type-checking --all-files
```

### PR/CI (Branch Comparison)

```bash
# Filter all results to files changed since main
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch origin/main

# With specific domains
./lucidshark scan --linting --type-checking --coverage --duplication \
  --base-branch origin/main
```

```bash
# Filter all results to files changed since main
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch origin/main

# With specific domains
./lucidshark scan --linting --type-checking --coverage --duplication \
  --base-branch origin/main
```

### MCP (AI Agents)

```python
# Default: scan uncommitted changes
mcp__lucidshark__scan(domains=["linting", "type_checking"])

# Full project scan
mcp__lucidshark__scan(domains=["all"], all_files=True)

# PR/CI: filter to branch changes
mcp__lucidshark__scan(domains=["all"], base_branch="origin/main")
```

## Domain-Specific Behavior

### Linting & Type Checking

**Display:** Issues are filtered to only those in changed files.

**Threshold Checking:** The `threshold_scope` controls which issues are checked against `fail_on`:

| Scope | Display | Threshold Check |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `changed` (default) | Changed files only | Check changed files issues |
| `project` | Changed files only | Check ALL project issues |
| `both` | Changed files only | Check both; fail if either has issues |

**Example with `scope: project`:**
```
Display: 2 issues in changed files
Project total: 15 issues
fail_on: error
Scope: project

Result: FAIL (15 project issues checked, not just the 2 displayed)
```

This is useful when you want to see only your changes, but ensure the entire project stays clean.

**Example with `scope: changed`:**
```
Display: 2 issues in changed files
Project total: 15 issues
fail_on: error
Scope: changed

Result: FAIL only if those 2 issues are errors (project issues ignored)
```

### Coverage

**Display:** Coverage metrics are filtered to changed files only.

**Threshold Checking:** The `threshold_scope` controls which coverage is checked:

| Scope | Display | Threshold Check |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `changed` (default) | Changed files coverage | Check changed files coverage |
| `project` | Changed files coverage | Check full project coverage |
| `both` | Changed files coverage | Check both; fail if either below threshold |

**Example:**
```
Display: 72% coverage on changed files
Project coverage: 85%
Threshold: 80%
Scope: changed

Result: FAIL (72% < 80% on changed files)
```

Unlike linting/type_checking, coverage filtering applies to both display AND the metrics used for threshold calculation (when scope=changed).

### Duplication

**Display:** Duplicates are filtered to those involving at least one changed file (file1 OR file2).

**Threshold Checking:** The `threshold_scope` controls which duplication percentage is checked:

| Scope | Display | Threshold Check |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `changed` | Duplicates involving changed files | Check filtered duplication % |
| `project` | Duplicates involving changed files | Check full project duplication % |
| `both` (default) | Duplicates involving changed files | Check both; fail if either exceeds threshold |

**Example:**
```
Display: Duplicates involving changed files (12%)
Project duplication: 8%
Threshold: 10%
Scope: changed

Result: FAIL (12% > 10% on changed files)
```

Like coverage, duplication filtering applies to both display AND the metrics used for threshold calculation (when scope=changed).

> **ℹ️ Why `scope=both` is the Default**
>
> The default `scope=both` prevents **project-wide duplication from creeping up over time**.
>
> With `scope=changed`, the filtered duplication percentage is calculated as:
> ```
> (duplicate_lines_involving_changed_files / total_project_lines) * 100
> ```
>
> **Example of creep with `scope=changed`:**
> - Project has 100,000 total lines
> - Threshold is 5%
> - Each PR adds ~50 duplicate lines involving changed files
> - Filtered percentage per PR: `50 / 100,000 = 0.05%` → PASS
> - After 200 PRs: project has 10,000 duplicate lines (10%) but each PR passed!
>
> With the default `scope=both`, the scan fails if **either** the filtered percentage OR the full project percentage exceeds the threshold, preventing this creep.
>
> **To use lenient checking (only changed files):**
> ```yaml
> pipeline:
>   duplication:
>     threshold: 5.0
>     threshold_scope: changed  # Only check changed files
> ```

## What Gets Included

### Default Mode (No `--base-branch`)

When running without `--base-branch`, LucidShark scans only uncommitted changes:

- **Staged changes** (`git add`)
- **Unstaged modifications**
- **Untracked files**

This is determined by:
```
git diff --cached --name-only      # Staged
git diff --name-only               # Unstaged
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard  # Untracked
```

### Branch Comparison Mode (`--base-branch`)

When using `--base-branch`, LucidShark includes:

**1. Committed Changes (Branch Comparison)**

Files committed to your branch since it diverged from the base:

```
git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only
```

This uses git's three-dot syntax which compares against the merge-base.

**2. Uncommitted Local Changes** (when working locally)

- **Staged changes** (`git add`)
- **Unstaged modifications**
- **Untracked files**

### Summary

| Mode | Flag | What's Scanned/Filtered |
|------|------|------------------------|
| **Default (local dev)** | (none) | Uncommitted changes only |
| **Full project** | `--all-files` | All files in project |
| **Branch comparison (CI)** | `--base-branch origin/main` | Branch changes + uncommitted |

| Environment | Working Tree | `--base-branch` Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **CI Pipeline** | Clean | Committed branch changes only |
| **Local Development** | Dirty | Committed + uncommitted changes |

        --base-branch origin/$(System.PullRequest.TargetBranch) \
        --coverage-threshold 80
    displayName: 'Run incremental scan'
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Strict PR linting

Fail if ANY linting issue in changed files, even if project has existing issues.

```bash
./lucidshark scan --linting --base-branch origin/main \
  --linting-threshold-scope changed
```

```bash
./lucidshark scan --linting --base-branch origin/main \
  --linting-threshold-scope changed
```

### Scenario 2: Coverage on changed files only

Changed files must have 80% coverage, but overall project can be lower.

```bash
./lucidshark scan --testing --coverage --base-branch origin/main \
  --coverage-threshold 80 --coverage-threshold-scope changed
```

```bash
./lucidshark scan --testing --coverage --base-branch origin/main \
  --coverage-threshold 80 --coverage-threshold-scope changed
```

### Scenario 3: Enforce both project and changed files

Fail if either project OR changed files exceed duplication threshold.

```bash
./lucidshark scan --duplication --base-branch origin/main \
  --duplication-threshold 10 --duplication-threshold-scope both
```

```bash
./lucidshark scan --duplication --base-branch origin/main \
  --duplication-threshold 10 --duplication-threshold-scope both
```

### Scenario 4: Full incremental scan before PR

Run all checks filtered to changed files:

```bash
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch origin/main \
  --coverage-threshold 80 \
  --duplication-threshold 10 \
  --coverage-threshold-scope changed \
  --linting-threshold-scope changed
```

```bash
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch origin/main \
  --coverage-threshold 80 \
  --duplication-threshold 10 \
  --coverage-threshold-scope changed \
  --linting-threshold-scope changed
```

## Local Development Workflow

### Check changes before committing

```bash
# On your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-new-feature

# Edit some files
vim src/myapp/utils.py

# Check all quality metrics for your changes
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch main

# Fix any issues, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new utility function"
```

```bash
# On your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-new-feature

# Edit some files
vim src/myapp/utils.py

# Check all quality metrics for your changes
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch main

# Fix any issues, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new utility function"
```

### Before creating a PR

```bash
# Ensure all changes meet quality standards
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch origin/main \
  --coverage-threshold 80 \
  --duplication-threshold 10

# If it passes, push
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

```bash
# Ensure all changes meet quality standards
./lucidshark scan --all --base-branch origin/main \
  --coverage-threshold 80 \
  --duplication-threshold 10

# If it passes, push
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

## Known Behaviors

### Domain Behavior Summary

| Domain | Display Filtered | Threshold Scope Affects Display | Threshold Scope Affects Check |
|--------|:----------------:|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| Linting | Yes | No (always shows changed) | Yes |
| Type Checking | Yes | No (always shows changed) | Yes |
| Coverage | Yes | No (always shows changed) | Yes |
| Duplication | Yes | No (always shows changed) | Yes |
| Security | No | N/A | N/A |
| Testing | No | N/A | N/A |

**Key difference:** For linting/type_checking, `threshold_scope` only affects which issues are checked against `fail_on`, not what's displayed. For coverage/duplication, filtering affects both display and the metrics.

### Security Domains Are Not Filtered

Security scans (SAST, SCA, IAC, Container) always report full project results, even with `--base-branch`. This is intentional:
- Security issues often span files or dependencies
- Filtering could hide critical vulnerabilities in unchanged but affected code
- Dependency vulnerabilities (SCA) apply project-wide

### Deleted Files Not Reported

Deleted files are excluded from changed files detection. When you delete a file in a PR:
- Linting/type checking won't report old issues from the deleted file
- Coverage won't include the deleted file's metrics
- This is correct behavior—issues in deleted files don't matter

### Duplication Percentage Context

For filtered duplication results:
- `duplicate_lines` = lines in filtered duplicates (involving changed files)
- `total_lines` = original full project lines
- Percentage reflects "what portion of the project these duplicates represent"

This gives context: "50 duplicate lines involving your changes represent 0.5% of the project"

> **Note:** Because the filtered percentage is relative to the full project's line count, each PR's contribution appears small. Over many PRs, this can lead to **duplication creep** where the overall project exceeds the threshold while each individual PR passes. The default `threshold_scope: both` prevents this. See the [Duplication section](#duplication) for details.

### Testing Always Runs Full Suite

Even with `--base-branch`, all tests run. Only coverage/failure **reporting** is filtered. This ensures:
- Indirect coverage is measured (test for `module_a` covers `module_b`)
- Regressions are caught
- Coverage percentages are accurate

## FAQ

### Does this skip tests for unchanged files?

No. All tests run for accurate coverage measurement. Only **reporting** is filtered.

### What if I have no changes on my branch?

Full project results are shown with a warning.

### Why does CI need `fetch-depth: 0`?

Branch comparison requires full git history. Shallow clones fail to find the merge-base.

### Can I exclude uncommitted changes?

Currently no. Commit your work first or run in CI where the working tree is clean.

### Why run full analysis if only showing changed files?

1. **Indirect coverage**: A test for `module_a.py` might cover code in `module_b.py`
2. **Cross-file detection**: Linting and duplication can detect issues spanning files
3. **Regression detection**: Running all tests catches regressions
4. **Accurate metrics**: Partial runs produce misleading numbers

### What about merge commits?

The three-dot syntax (`main...HEAD`) compares against the merge-base, so merge commits from main into your branch don't count as "your changes."

## Error Handling

### Branch Not Found

```
Error: Could not compare against branch 'origin/main'.
Ensure the branch exists and git history is available (use fetch-depth: 0 in CI).
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify the branch name is correct
- In CI, ensure `fetch-depth: 0` or equivalent is set
- Run `git fetch origin main` to fetch the branch

### No Changed Files

```
Warning: No files changed since origin/main, showing full results
```

Full project results are shown when there are no changes.
